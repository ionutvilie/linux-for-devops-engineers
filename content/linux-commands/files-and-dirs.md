## `cd`

$ cd /var/log/journal/   # cd to /var/log
$ pwd
/var/log/journal/

$ cd ../..                # cd two paths up, etc
$ cd                      # cd to home dir
$ cd -                    # cd to previous dir
```

## `ls`

Lists the contents of a directory

```bash
$ ls /var/log/
$ ls -a /var/log/         # do not ignore entries starting with . (hidden files)
$ ls -l /var/log/         # use a long listing format
$ ls -alh /var/log/       # human-readable with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K 234M 2G etc.
$ ls -ltr /var/log/       # t (sort by modification time, newest first) r (reverse order while sorting)
```

## `cat`

Short for concatenate, it is used to list the contents of a file on the standard output \(stdout\)

```bash
$ cat metasyntactic-vars.txt
foo

buz
qux
```

## `cp`

```bash
# copy source destination
cp metasyntactic-vars.txt metasyntactic-vars
```

## `mv`

```bash
# mv source destination
$ mv metasyntactic-vars metasyntactic-variables   # rename file
$ mv metasyntactic-vars.txt /tmp/                 # move file to /tmp dir
$ ls /tmp
metasyntactic-vars.txt
$ mv /tmp/metasyntactic-vars.txt .                # move file to current location
```

## `mkdir` & `rmdir`

Make a new directory or remove dir

```bash
mkdir /tmp/foo                     # make a new dir foo in /tmp
mkdir -p /tmp/bar/foo              # make a new dir foo in /tmp/bar and create parent directories as needed
mkdir -p /tmp/test/{foo,bar,buz}   # make dirs foo bar buz in /tmp/test/ and create parent directories as needed
rmdir /tmp/foo                     # removes a non-empty directory
```

## `rm`

```bash
rm /tmp/foo                 # removes a non-empty directory
rm -r /tmp/bar/foo          # removes foo directory
rm metasyntactic-vars.txt   # removes metasyntactic-vars.txt file
```

## `file`

```bash
$ file var/log/dmesg
var/log/dmesg: UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines
$ file /bin/bash

find /home/ubuntu -name *.txt       # find all .txt files in the /home/ubuntu.
find /var/ -name sys* 2>/dev/null  # find everything that starts with sys in /var/ and sub-directories
                                   # and redirect errors to /dev/null
